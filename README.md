# Intro <a name = "Intro"></a>

This project was previously developed for 'Devops Developer', found on YouTube with the title """ Progress Bar in React Js """.

However, during my development the main change I made was to use different colors for different levels of progress; for example, up to 50% red color, and in addition green color.

In youtube's video this project was developed with Html, CSS in React.js.

However, during my development the main change is that I used React VITE.
